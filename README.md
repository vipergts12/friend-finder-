# friend-finder-
//* I was not able to finish the assignment since I could not get the routes to work properly. I was able to modify the previous class assigment to be similar. 
For this app we are instructed to make an app that would match you up with some new friends.; 

first step is to make sure that you have your file structure correct as outlined in instructions.
File directory: 
FriendFinder
  - .gitignore
  - app
    - data
      - friends.js
    - public
      - home.html
      - survey.html
    - routing
      - apiRoutes.js
      - htmlRoutes.js
  - node_modules
  - package.json
  - server.js

The app should have atleast 10 questions and the questions should be a selection from 1 to 5; 1 being the least and 5 being the most.

Based on the responses; the app should suggest a match from a predetirmined array of fictional people.

Sample array of people
{
  "name":"Ahmed",
  "photo":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/6/005/064/1bd/3435aa3.jpg",
  "scores":[
      5,
      1,
      4,
      4,
      5,
      1,
      2,
      5,
      4,
      1
    ]
}


The api and html routes should be in different folders and not in the server.js file. 

The format and style is very similar to the Final Star Wars in class assignments and it would be smart to use them as guides. 

If the logic for the homework assignment can not be completed; psudo code the answers. 

The App should be submitted to Heroku. 

To post to Heroku: create a new app and name it; then from the app page click on deploy for step by step customized instructions on how to post to Heroku.

To submit to BCS use the github repo url to submit. 

Any questions can be added to the slack channel "Ask the class".

Last: add your homework assignment to your profile in github.
